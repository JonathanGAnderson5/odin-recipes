    <h2>It's All in the Pan</h2>
    <p>
      A signature characteristic of Detroit-style pizza is its squared shape and
      crispy edged crust. So, in this case the pan is just as important as the
      other ingredients. The original pizzas were made in thick blue steel pans
      that were originally manufactured to store auto parts. Today, the same
      anodized steel style pan is used, sans the auto parts. A brand to check
      out at home is made by LloydsPans, which is the brand of pan Chef John
      uses in his recipe for Detroit-Style Pizza. (Yes, it's a rectangular pan,
      but the pizza is called "square." That's not confusing at all.)

    <h2>The Dough and Crust</h2>
    <p>
      When it comes to making the dough, you'll want to use bread flour to
      achieve that airy, focaccia-like texture. You'll actually proof the dough
      in the pan you are cooking in, which makes it easier (at least for cleanup
      purposes). As for the crust, it's one of the most important parts of this
      style of pizza. To achieve that crispy crust, you want to make sure that
      you have a well-greased pan. You'll want to take that pizza out of the pan
      to cool as soon as you can, so the crust stays crisp and doesn't get
      soggy. Another key to the crust is the way the cheese melds with it. Note
      that the cheese is placed all the way to the edges to achieve those
      coveted golden-brown cheesy crust corners.
